# Contributing
The preferred way to contribute is through pull requests on GitHub. Get a GitHub account if you don't have it already and clone the repository at https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib with the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page. Check out your clone to your machine, code away, push your changes to your clone and submit a pull request; instructions are available at https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo.

In case you need them, more detailed instructions for creating pull requests are at https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests, and a basic guide to GitHub is at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/. GitHub also provides interactive learning at https://lab.github.com/.

It's likely that we won't merge your code right away, and we'll ask for some changes instead. Don't be discouraged! That's normal; the library is complex, and thus it might take some time to become familiar with it and to use it in an idiomatic way.
